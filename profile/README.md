# SoloVector

**Focused engineering. Directed systems. Predictable outcomes.**

## About  
SoloVector is a precision-software unit. We deliver narrow-scope systems with low surface area, minimal dependencies, and predictable behavior. The goal: build tools that execute, not frameworks that waver.

## What We Do  
- Design and build micro-APIs, internal utilities, production-tools.  
- Operate with one deliberate axis: scope. Output defined by clarity, not volume.  
- Use .NET for core services, static front ends, GitHub-native automation, and cloud-agnostic deployment.

## Core Principles  
- Straight paths. No branching agendas.  
- Minimal dependencies. Predictable behavior.  
- No broad product lines. No diffusion of purpose.  
- Each build stands alone and serves one function.

## Stack & Infrastructure  
- .NET runtime for core backend services.  
- Static, performant front ends.  
- Automated CI/CD via GitHub workflows.  
- Cloud-agnostic deployment models.
